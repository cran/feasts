\title{Multiple seasonal decomposition by Loess}
\usage{
STL(.data, formula, iterations = 2, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A tsibble.}

\item{formula}{Decomposition specification (see "Specials" section).}

\item{iterations}{Number of iterations to use to refine the seasonal component.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed to \code{\link[stats:stl]{stats::stl()}}.}
}
\value{
A \code{\link[fabletools:dable]{fabletools::dable()}} containing the decomposed trend, seasonality
and remainder from the STL decomposition.
}
\description{
Decompose a time series into seasonal, trend and remainder components.
Seasonal components are estimated iteratively using STL. Multiple seasonal periods are
allowed. The trend component is computed for the last iteration of STL.
Non-seasonal time series are decomposed into trend and remainder only.
In this case, \code{\link[stats]{supsmu}} is used to estimate the trend.
Optionally, the time series may be Box-Cox transformed before decomposition.
Unlike \code{\link[stats]{stl}}, \code{mstl} is completely automated.

\section{Specials}{


\subsection{trend}{
The \code{trend} special is used to specify the trend extraction parameters.
\preformatted{
trend(window, degree, jump)
}

\tabular{ll}{
\code{window} \tab The span (in lags) of the loess window, which should be odd. If NULL, the default, nextodd(ceiling((1.5*period) / (1-(1.5/s.window)))), is taken.\cr
\code{degree} \tab The degree of locally-fitted polynomial. Should be zero or one. \cr
\code{jump}   \tab Integers at least one to increase speed of the respective smoother. Linear interpolation happens between every \code{jump}th value.
}
}

\subsection{season}{
The \code{season} special is used to specify the season extraction parameters.
\preformatted{
season(period = NULL, window = 13, degree, jump)
}

\tabular{ll}{
\code{period} \tab The periodic nature of the seasonality. This can be either a number indicating the number of observations in each seasonal period, or text to indicate the duration of the seasonal window (for example, annual seasonality would be "1 year").\cr
\code{window} \tab The span (in lags) of the loess window, which should be odd. If the \code{window} is set to \code{"periodic"} or \code{Inf}, the seasonal pattern will be fixed. The window size should be odd and at least 7, according to Cleveland et al. \cr
\code{degree} \tab The degree of locally-fitted polynomial. Should be zero or one. \cr
\code{jump}   \tab Integers at least one to increase speed of the respective smoother. Linear interpolation happens between every \code{jump}th value.
}
}

\subsection{lowpass}{
The \code{lowpass} special is used to specify the low-pass filter parameters.
\preformatted{
lowpass(window, degree, jump)
}

\tabular{ll}{
\code{window} \tab The span (in lags) of the loess window of the low-pass filter used for each subseries. Defaults to the smallest odd integer greater than or equal to the seasonal \code{period} which is recommended since it prevents competition between the trend and seasonal components. If not an odd integer its given value is increased to the next odd one. \cr
\code{degree} \tab The degree of locally-fitted polynomial. Must be zero or one. \cr
\code{jump}   \tab Integers at least one to increase speed of the respective smoother. Linear interpolation happens between every \code{jump}th value.
